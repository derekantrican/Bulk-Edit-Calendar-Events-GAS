# Bulk-Edit-Calendar-Events

Bulk Edit Calendar Events is a script written in Google Apps Script. The goal is to allow any user to edit calendar events in...well....bulk. Currently the only way to edit more than one event at once is if the events are part of a recurring series. This program allows (amongst other things) mass deletion, renaming, and moving.
